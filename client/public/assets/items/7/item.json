          "The distinguishing feature of all puffballs is that they do not have an open cap with spore-bearing gills. Instead, spores are produced internally, in a spheroidal fruitbody.",
          "The fruitbody remains closed until after the spores have been released from the basidia.",
          "Eventually, it develops an aperture, or dries, becomes brittle, and splits, and the spores escape are fungi, so named because clouds of brown dust-like spores are emitted when the mature fruitbody bursts or is impacted."
